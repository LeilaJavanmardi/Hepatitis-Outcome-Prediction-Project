## Hepatitis Outcome Prediction Project

### Project Overview

This project aims to predict outcomes (live or die) for hepatitis patients using clinical data. Hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver, ranges from acute (resolving within six months) to chronic forms that can lead to serious complications like cirrhosis and liver cancer.

### Data Description
Two CSV files are provided:<br>
TRAIN SET: About 100 rows with labels, used for training the model.<br>
TEST SET: About 55 rows without labels, used for model validation.

### Model Development
Models evaluated include **Logistic Regression, Bagging, AdaBoost Classifier, and Random Patch**.
Data normalization and other preprocessing techniques are applied to improve model performance.<br>
Model Evaluation: Comparisons are made using an external solution set to validate the accuracy of different models.
